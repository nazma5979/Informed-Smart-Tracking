CORE PRODUCT SUMMARY (for context)

We are building Mood Patterns + Wheel of Feels as a browser-based web app:

- Tech: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, no backend, no push notifications.
- Storage: IndexedDB for all app data (feelings, check-ins, tags, scales, schedules).
- Core purpose: Offline-first Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) mood diary.
- Main flows:
  - Fast check-in using a 3-ring Wheel/List of emotions.
  - Optional context tags, numeric scales (e.g. energy/focus/stress), and notes.
  - Insights/analytics computed locally.
  - CHOOSENOTIF: local-only reminder helper (random or fixed) while app is open.
- Hard constraints:
  - No remote storage of mood data.
  - No AI insights.
  - No backend or push API for reminders.
